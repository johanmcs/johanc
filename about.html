		Hello, my name is Johan Cristobal, a first-year graduate student in the Mathematics Department at University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), pursuing a doctorate degree in Math! I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the chaotic year of 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics of Computation. My main goal in life is to inspire people to do whatever brings them joy and fulfillment, and I think being an instructor will help me do just that.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <font color= "red">math</font>, I like differential equations. I don't really know much else besides that right now, but I do know that I find animation and physics-engines in video games very interesting. I would like to someday help in making the formulas those engines run on.
	</p>
	<p>
		In <font color = "blue">the arts</font>, I like to create digital art through the Adobe Suite. I can fairly decently use Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro. And I am also currently learning how to use Adobe Dreamweaver and Adobe Audition! I also like music, I dabble in a bit of basic compositions when I get the rare inspiration.
	</p>
	<p>
		In <font color = "#0E8606">other sciences</font>, I like computer science, but I lean more on the theoretical side of things. But don't be fooled, I can proficiently code in C/C++, while being vaguely efficient in Python and LISP. I also like Physics, mainly the basic stuff because I spent a year facilitating discussions and sections for an introductory Physics class.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		In my attempt to learn more about math and how to be a good teacher and mentor, I pursued a graduate degree.
		</br>
		In my attempt to learn more about the arts, I have a <a href = "www.youtube.com/user/johanmode"><b>Youtube channel</b></a>. I learned how to storyboard, video edit, and even compose music for some of my videos. I also found that using YouTube has helped tremendously in practicing speaking publically, in person and through Zoom.
		</br>
		In my attempt to learn more about other sciences, I started this website, which hopefully shows how much I've learned in web-design (computer science). I also am planning on taking courses outside the math department at UNL to learn about other subjects, like I did in my time at UCLA.
	</p>
	
	<p> As for everything else? <br>If it's not already on my list of things to look into, then I'll get my grubby hands on it someday.
	</p>

		I'd like to take this section to provide quotes I heard in my life that I really like: </br>
		"<i>Kung masaya ka, masaya rin ako. Wala akong paki-alam kung ano ang ginagawa mo sa college, just enjoy life. </i>" my dad, Roberto </br>
		"<i>We've always been able to do more with less, so you can do this.</i>" my sister, Meziah </br>
		"<i>Dude, stop trying to be such a perfectionist. It's the imperfections that make it perfect.</i>" my friend, Andgielika </br>
		"<i>One step at a time.</i>" my friend, Andgielika
		"<i>Fail Forward Fast.</i>" one of my instructors at UCLA, Sassone </br>
		"<i>It took one person to believe in me, to tell me I could do this for me to do this.</i>" my favorite professor from UCLA, De Santiago </br>
		"<i>You're already doing what you set out to do.</i>" a lot of people </br>
		"<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>" a lot of people
